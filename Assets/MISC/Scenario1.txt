[Written on 11th November 2019, when Evan and Sinro meet a bully]

Sinro: Shoot it's him!

Bully: How's it going with those crimes?

Sinro: I told you before, they're not crimes!
What do you want?

Bully: Oh? Who's this chump next to you?

Sinro: He's just some guy I found from somewhere. I don't really know him well.
He's kind of quiet.

Bully: Hey you, Evan! Why are you siding with a fool like him?

Evan: 
	- Not sure.
	- He's the first one I saw
	- He's cool

[If Evan picks 'not sure']

Bully: Ha! Not too long you'll find out he's a caused loads of crimes-

Sinro: Can you just shut up and leave me alone! I'm trying to take [Hero] out of here.

Bully: Evan:, here let me take you out instead - don't stay with this fool.
I'm telling ya, he's a master crimminal of several acts.

Evan:
	- ...
	- Okay then.

[Okay then]

Bully: Good awnser, now come with me and I will show you around and give you the exit.

Seymour: Evan, come to your senses!

[Hero]: ....

Bully: What's with the poker face? Knock some sense in you, Sinro's a criminal, you never know what he's going-

Sinro: That's my line! 
***

You're just going to lock [Hero] up and that's another life I have to save. I've already got my own problems.

Bully: Don't put words in my mouth, you filthy pig! That's it you're going to get it!

Sinro: Get what?

Bully: Y'know... 'it'? This little butt of mine into your face.

Sinro: No thanks, cmon [Hero], let's kick his butt!

[Hero]: (I don't know who I should side with, but from the nature of the bully perhaps I should side with Sinro).
