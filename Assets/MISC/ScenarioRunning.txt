[SCENE 1]

Bully: What are you doing here, Sinro?
You should be giving up already!

Sinro: Yikes! He's here! Evan! Run!

Evan: ...!

Bully: And who do you happen to be? Another one of his little freinds?

Evan:
	> Maybe.

	Sinro: He's just trying to distract you Evan, run!

	Bully: I'm trying to talk to him IDIOT!
	You're really pissing me off!

	> ...
	
	Bully: Not talking to me, huh?
	I'll make you talk!

*Run begins*


[SCENE 2]

Bully: Freinds! FREINDS! GET THEM BOTH!

Freinds: Yes sir!
Under the order of our leader we shall capture you!

Sinro: There's more of them! Quick, jump across these platforms!

[AFTER GOING THROUGH PLATFORMS]

Sinro: Great! Now follow me!

[AFTER LOOSING THEM]

Sinro: Whew I think we lost them for now...
They're easy to outrun, but you really don't want to get in their way when they are in your way.
