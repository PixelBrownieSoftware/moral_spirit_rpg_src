Sinro: Before we start fighting, have you ever fought these kinds of battles?

Evan: [I have played some RPG games...]

	Sinro: Um... okay... so I'm sure you know about the charge meter, health, moves.
		But there is something in this game that you probably haven't seen in other RPGS, do you know what that is?

	Evan: [Yeah]
		Sinro: Well If you know your stuff, then let's not waste any time!

	Evan: [No]
		Sinro: You see the 'Action' option? You can talk or interact with enemies?
		These lower the enemies stamina points, if their stamina points are lowered to zero or less they will start to waste turns
		At this point, defeating them would be easier because if they can't use any skll moves, there's no way the'll use anything strong.
		Or you could spare them, they'll give you items you can't get if you just defeated them, but you'll gain less exp.
		Plus if they have freinds around, they probably won't like you bribing the target in question, so you'll need to weaken them first.
		There are also recovery ones where people like me can help you recover your stamina, but keep in mind that you can't use most them on yourself
		Stronger talk moves also cost talk points which can be gained by guarding, fighting or saying effective things.
		Any questions?
		
		Evan: [Why don't they drop these items when killed]
			Sinro: I don't have a clear answer to this, this world is pretty strange so not all logic works like it does in your world.
			Sinro: Well then, let's not waste any time!

		Evan [No]
			Sinro: Well then, let's not waste any time!


Evan: [I don't think so]
	
	Sinro: You have hit points, stamina points, talk points and charge points.
	       Keep track of your hit points, if you loose all of it you probably won't be getting back up anytime soon.
	       If they are low, always ask me to heal you up since I know 'Sana' which is a healing skill.

	       Stamina points are used for skills, stuff like attacks, healing, stat boosts et cetra.
	       It's also used as a second health bar, when it reaches zero or below you won't loose, but you will waste turns having to recover SP.
	       If it reaches too negative however, you won't be able to fight, unless you have someone to help you up.
	       
	       But don't worry, I have your back thanks to the Action skills, these can be used
