[LOOKING AT A BUNCH OF BOOKS IN A CASTLE]
There is an old wooden bookshelf filled to the brim with colourful books. Want to pick out one?

	> Yes
	As you looked through the shelves, you found one book that caught your eye. It was a red covered book.
	It has the title "How to capture annoying people". You decide to read through it.
	...
	.....
	The writing was quite cheesy, you sniggered a bit at some of the subtly put jokes.

	Sinro: Pfft... some of the lines there are so ridiculous, why would 'Bully' expect any of his methoods to work?
	Does he use these books as actual advice? 
	They seem more like jokes.
	
	> No
	You decided not to pick out a book.
