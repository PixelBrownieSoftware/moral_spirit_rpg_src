Hero ends up in a strange place and finds a character named Sinro.

[Hero]: (Where am I? This dosen't look familiar at all.)
(That guy seems to be staring at me... quite startled actually)

Sinro: Gah! Leave me alone!

[Hero]:
	- Who are you?
	- What's with the tension?

[Hero]: Who are you?

Sinro: Who are YOU? What do you want from me?

[Hero tells Sinro his name]

Sinro: I swear I didn't do anything! I'm not a criminal! 
I was just trying to do what I think is right!

[Hero]: (What on earth are you blathering on about?)

Sinro: Wait, you don't look like you know what I'm talking about do you?

Hero: (No, I don't. I'm just a passerby who ended up here).

Sinro: Since you don't look like you're going to handcuff me, let me introduce myself.
I'm Sinro. I've commited what people at least think are a bunch of crimes.
