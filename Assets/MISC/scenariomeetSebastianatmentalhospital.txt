Sebastian: Hey! The name is Sebastian!
They got you didn't they?
Evan: ...
Sebastian: D-don't intimidate me with that face.
I'm not here to harm you, I'm here to help you out.
Evan: *Looks at Sebastian doubtfully*
Sebastian: You see-
*A spirit from Evan uncontrollably throws a near miss at Sebastian*
Sebastian: Wow... you really need my help. If they find me - no, you too, we're bound for real trouble.
Evan: *Shakes in fear*
Sebastian: You can't control that spirit huh?
Evan: *Nods his head* (Yeah... it keeps on jerking out of me randomly)
Sebastian: What if I told you that I had a spirit too?
*A dragon like spirit comes out*
I know, I was like you when this odd spirit thing came out, I had no idea what to do. I started
becoming a nusicance to the people around me because of it. 
That's when I turned to a guy named Ralph for advice, he helped me control my inner demon. 
But little did I know he was actually trying to use me and my spirit.
Evan: *Spirit comes out again and tries to punch Sebastian*
*Sebastian's spirit parry's the punch*
Sebastian: Without understanding your true self, you will keep on letting your inner spirit take control of you.
Evan: (T-that dream I had last night!)
*The spirit tries to punch Sebastian and misses again*
Evan: (It's happening again! My thoughts are coming out of control).
*The spirit constantly punches sebastian, all being parried*
Evan: Ugh! Gaah!
*The spririt gets out of control*
Sebastian: Do you know why your attacks are constatnly failing?
